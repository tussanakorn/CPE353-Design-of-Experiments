# CPE353 â€“ Design of Experiments (1/64) KMUTT
This was part of the lab and homework I learned from CPE353.

### Instructor : Assoc.Prof. Peerapon Siripongwutikorn, Ph.D.

### Course Description
This course introduces students with fundamental concepts and techniques in design and analysis of experiments
and data analysis. Topics include regression analysis, single-factor experiments with analysis of variance,
experiments with blocking factors, factorial experiments, two-level factorial and fractional factorial experiments,
and response surface methodology.
